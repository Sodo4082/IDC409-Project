# IDC409-Project

Web-scrapping Project on Institute websites.

There are two codes given. One is the code for webscraping and all the analysis that was possible on the IISER Mohali website for the faculty page. We wanted to make a generalized code so that the code works not only on the website we chose but also on other websites. But, since every website has different information in different tags and formats , achieving this manually would not be possible. 

So as a solution was: we looked to impliment chatGPT API which would give any information from the website once the scrapped data is provided. Since the API is paid we implimented a free API of another LLM(Large Language Model) called Zephyr-7b-alpha. It has the limitation that it takes a lot of memory to run so please run it on google colab.
